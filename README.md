# EyeTrackingAnalysis
Code for various eye tracking analyses I ran earlier in my PhD. This code forms the basis of two (unpublished) eye tracking works -- one analysing the effect of hemisphericity (and trying to derive a measure of hemisphericity) from changes in pupil dilation and microsaccade patterns during reading. The second tries to verify a maximum-information model of visual foraging and reading times based upon bigram frequencies. The code was primarily written in summer 2018. It is primarily written in R for LMER modelling but with heavy duty computation performed in Julia or Python.
